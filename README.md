Go to the website! That's what it's for :)

# Something cool that came out of this project
I got great experience with React and Typescript while rebuilding my personal project, but something that happened most recently (and that I am proud of)
is the automated build process that I have created. Currently, this repo has a shell script that will build a new version of my website, copy all of the build files from my development directory, and then commit them to this repo. Very cool!
