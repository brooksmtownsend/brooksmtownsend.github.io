# The evolution of brookstownsend.me
There have been three versions of this website since its migration from github.io's hosting.
- HTML/CSS/JS
- React, Typescript, Apache and no back-end
- React, Typescript, Express, MongoDB

The first iteration was when I was new to web dev, the second after beginning to learn more and more about the latest and greatest of the web, and now with the most recent version I have been rebuilding it with the MEAN stack as an exercise in development, as well as committing myself to updating this website as often as possible (which is much easier with a backend)
