                    I worked at SentryOne last summer as an iOS development intern. As a sophomore intern, I was the youngest one in the office that was doing development. Working for a company was very different than me just coding in my room. Agile development, TDD, and code reviews were a huge part of what I was doing, and what makes me a better programmer today.
                    This is me with all of the other engineering interns with some of our new SentryOne swag.

                            I work as a COMP110 UTA at UNC Chapel Hill along with all of these other wonderful people. COMP110 is the introduction to programming course at UNC, and is the largest undergraduate course at over 900 students per semester.
                            I personally tutor hundreds of students a month, and I lead review sessions along with another UTA. I am also a part of the team leads, which is a special team of the head TA's that meet with the professor once a week to discuss the course.
