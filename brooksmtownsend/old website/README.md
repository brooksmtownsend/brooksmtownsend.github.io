Personal Website

Hello everyone. My name is Brooks Townsend and I felt like I wanted a place where I could put up my personal projects as well as information about me.

One of my main motivators for making this page is so that I can put it on my resume, and have a nice page for employers to check out when they want to know who I am.
However, I also wanted to get some practice in HTML/CSS so that I could legitmately work on web projects in the future.

As of right now, it is incomplete. However, if you are looking on and find a problem or something that can be improved, let me know!
